Some AjgularJS examples as I'm learning how this stuff works

Why Tigley? Yeah, it's my cat's name


1) route-resolve/
Shows how to use :resolve in route config to trigger a broadcast message
which is then caught by a controller outside the view to update the header.

This is a client/server app. A node.js w/express server is included. You will
need to install node and npm, then run 'nmp install'. To run the server it's 
just 'node server.js' and then just open a browser to localhost:3009


2) funbuttons/ 
Shows how a directive can be fully encapsulated with a custom
controller and accept complex data, including callbacks

This is a client-side only angular app, just open the index.html
